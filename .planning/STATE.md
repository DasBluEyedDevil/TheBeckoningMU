# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Review & hardening phase before any new features (brownfield safety)
- [Roadmap]: Builder approval workflow before sandbox/promotion (gate unsafe operations)
- [Roadmap]: Trigger system last (depends on bridge layer from sandbox phase)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Phase 5 (Sandbox) needs run_in_main_thread() integration testing -- highest architectural risk
- [Research]: Phase 7 (Triggers) V5 condition system is novel -- needs design research during planning
- [Research]: JSON map_data needs schema versioning before Phase 5
