## Out of Scope (v1)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full web MUD client replacement | Web portal complements the telnet/webclient, not replaces it |
| Rich text/WYSIWYG room descriptions | MUDs use plain text; ANSI preview at most |
| Stat optimization assistant | Undermines V5 roleplaying spirit |
| Real-time collaborative building | Enormous complexity, minimal benefit for MU* building |
| Automated character approval | V5 characters require narrative review by staff |
| Free-form Python in triggers | Security risk; use whitelisted actions only |
| Mobile-specific responsive design | Desktop browser is primary target |
| Player dashboard (messages, notifications) | MUD client handles this |
| Game wiki/help system on web | In-game help is sufficient |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 28 of 28 v1 requirements (100%)

**Adjusted:**
- BLDX-01: Up/Down (U/D) vertical exits not fully implemented — 8 horizontal directions work, vertical can be created manually

**Deferred to v2:**
- CHAR-06 through CHAR-08 (character sheet view, staff trait comments, approval history)
- BLDX-06 through BLDX-07 (custom templates, template inheritance)
- TRIG-08 (custom trigger action development guide)

**Technical Debt:**
- Up/Down vertical exit support in compass system
- Minor code duplication in scripts.py is_valid method
- In-clan discipline validation (needs ClanDiscipline model)
