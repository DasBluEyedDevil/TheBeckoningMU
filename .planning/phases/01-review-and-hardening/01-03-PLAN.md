<objective>
Verify all hardening changes from Plans 01 and 02 work correctly end-to-end. This plan performs a manual smoke test of the critical security fixes and validation logic.

Purpose: Catch any regressions from the CSRF, auth, concurrency, and validation changes before the phase is marked complete. This is a blocking verification gate.

Output: Confirmed working system with all security hardening applied.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Automated verification of security fixes</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run a comprehensive verification of all changes made in Plans 01 and 02. This is a code review + static analysis pass, not a test suite (Evennia requires a running server for full integration tests).

**Step 1: Verify CSRF exemptions are fully removed**
```bash
grep -rn "csrf_exempt" beckonmu/traits/api.py beckonmu/web/builder/views.py
```
Expected: Zero matches. If any remain, report as a gap.

**Step 2: Verify authentication checks are present**
For each of these 7 endpoints, confirm `is_authenticated` check exists:
- TraitCategoriesAPI
- TraitsAPI
- DisciplinePowersAPI
- CharacterValidationAPI
- CharacterImportAPI (should also have is_staff)
- CharacterExportAPI (should also have ownership check)
- CharacterAvailableTraitsAPI (should also have ownership check)

```bash
grep -A5 "class TraitCategoriesAPI" beckonmu/traits/api.py
grep -A5 "class CharacterImportAPI" beckonmu/traits/api.py
# etc. for all 7
```

**Step 3: Verify V5 pool validation**
Confirm that `validate_v5_chargen_pools` is defined AND called from `enhanced_import_character_from_json`:
```bash
grep -n "def validate_v5_chargen_pools" beckonmu/traits/utils.py
grep -n "validate_v5_chargen_pools" beckonmu/traits/utils.py
```
Expected: At least 2 matches (definition + call site).

Verify the function checks all 5 pools: attributes, skills, disciplines, advantages, flaws.

**Step 4: Verify CharacterCreateAPI to V5 validation wiring**
Confirm that CharacterCreateAPI uses the enhanced_import_character_from_json function which runs pool validation:
```bash
grep -n "enhanced_import_character_from_json" beckonmu/traits/api.py
```
Expected: At least 1 match in CharacterCreateAPI.post() method, confirming the key_link from api.py to utils.py pool validation is intact.

**Step 5: Verify exporter fixes**
```bash
grep -n "@py" beckonmu/web/builder/exporter.py
grep -n "exit_data\['" beckonmu/web/builder/exporter.py
grep -n "obj_data\['" beckonmu/web/builder/exporter.py
```
Expected: Zero matches for all three.

**Step 6: Verify concurrency control**
Confirm version field exists in model and is used in SaveProjectView:
```bash
grep -n "version" beckonmu/web/builder/models.py
grep -n "version" beckonmu/web/builder/views.py
```
Expected: version field in model, version check in SaveProjectView.

**Step 7: Verify validator improvements**
Confirm shape validation exists:
```bash
grep -n "isinstance" beckonmu/web/builder/validators.py
grep -n "\.get(" beckonmu/web/builder/validators.py
```

**Step 8: Check for Python syntax errors**
```bash
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/traits/api.py', doraise=True)"
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/traits/utils.py', doraise=True)"
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/web/builder/views.py', doraise=True)"
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/web/builder/exporter.py', doraise=True)"
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/web/builder/validators.py', doraise=True)"
python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('beckonmu/web/builder/models.py', doraise=True)"
```
Expected: All compile successfully with no errors.

**Step 9: Verify no unintended changes**
Run git diff --stat to confirm only the expected files were modified.
Expected: Only the 6 files listed in Plans 01 and 02 files_modified appear in the diff (plus migration file). No other files touched.
  </action>
  <verify>
All 9 verification steps pass with expected results:
- Step 1: 0 csrf_exempt matches across both files
- Step 2: 7 endpoints confirmed to have is_authenticated checks
- Step 3: validate_v5_chargen_pools has at least 2 grep matches (definition + call)
- Step 4: enhanced_import_character_from_json appears in api.py (CharacterCreateAPI wiring confirmed)
- Step 5: 0 matches for @py, exit_data[', obj_data[' in exporter
- Step 6: version appears in both models.py and views.py
- Step 7: isinstance and .get( appear in validators.py
- Step 8: All 6 Python files compile without syntax errors
- Step 9: Git diff shows only expected 6 files modified (plus migration)
  </verify>
  <done>
Automated verification confirms:
- 0 csrf_exempt decorators remain
- 7 endpoints have authentication checks
- V5 pool validation is defined and called
- CharacterCreateAPI to enhanced_import_character_from_json wiring confirmed (key_link intact)
- Exporter has no @py or unsafe key access
- Concurrency control is implemented
- Validator checks data shape
- All files compile without syntax errors
- Only expected files were modified
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete security hardening of character creation and grid builder systems:
1. Removed all 14 @csrf_exempt decorators (11 in traits/api.py, 3 in builder/views.py)
2. Added authentication to 7 unprotected API endpoints
3. Added staff-only check to CharacterImportAPI (was completely open)
4. Added ownership checks to CharacterExportAPI and CharacterAvailableTraitsAPI
5. Added idempotent approval check (409 on double-approve)
6. Sanitized error messages (no ORM detail leakage)
7. Added server-side V5 chargen pool validation (attributes, skills, disciplines, advantages, flaws)
8. Removed @py injection risk from batch exporter
9. Fixed unsafe dictionary key access in exporter
10. Added optimistic concurrency control to builder saves
11. Added schema_version to new project map data
12. Improved validator to check room/exit data shapes
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Character Creation Flow:**
1. Start the Evennia server: `evennia start` (or `evennia restart` if already running)
2. Open browser to http://localhost:4001/character-creation/
3. Verify the character creation page loads (CSRF token is correctly included)
4. Try filling out and submitting a test character -- confirm no 403 CSRF errors
5. Check Evennia logs for any errors: `evennia --log` or check the server log file

**Grid Builder Flow:**
6. Open browser to http://localhost:4001/builder/
7. Verify the builder dashboard loads
8. Try creating/saving a builder project -- confirm no 403 CSRF errors

**Grid Builder Save/Load Round-Trip (REVW-02 correctness):**
9. Create a new project with multiple rooms (at least 3) and exits connecting them
10. Add room descriptions, names, and V5 settings to at least one room
11. Save the project
12. Reload the browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
13. Open the same project and verify ALL data is identical:
    - Room names match what was entered
    - Room descriptions match
    - Exit connections between rooms are preserved
    - V5 settings on rooms are preserved
    - Grid positions of rooms are preserved
14. Save the project again without changes, then reload again to confirm no data drift

If anything returns 403 Forbidden that previously worked, the CSRF token may not be correctly sent by that specific frontend page. Report which page/action fails.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if everything works, or describe which pages/actions produce errors</resume-signal>

5. No 403 CSRF errors on previously-working functionality
6. Server starts without errors

- No regressions in existing functionality
