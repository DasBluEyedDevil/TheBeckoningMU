SECTION 1: HELP SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

LOCATION: /home/user/TheBeckoningMU/beckonmu/world/help_entries.py

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Uses Evennia's FILE_HELP_ENTRY_MODULES system
- Entries defined as a HELP_ENTRY_DICTS list containing dictionaries
- Each dictionary entry has:
  * 'key': (str) - The help topic name/command to look up
  * 'text': (str) - The help content (supports # subtopic sections)
  * 'category': (str, optional) - Category for organizing help (defaults to DEFAULT_HELP_CATEGORY)
  * 'aliases': (list, optional) - Alternative names for the help topic
  * 'locks': (str, optional) - Access control ('view' for index visibility, 'read' for content visibility)

FILE FORMAT EXAMPLE:
```
{
    "key": "topic_name",
    "aliases": ["alt_name"],
    "category": "Category Name",
    "locks": "read:perm(Developer)",
    "text": """
        Main help text here.
        
        # Subtopic 1
        Subtopic content here.
        
        ## Sub-subtopic
        More details.
    """
}
```

REGISTRATION:
- Evennia reads HELP_ENTRY_DICTS list during server initialization
- Settings configured in: beckonmu/server/conf/settings.py (FILE_HELP_ENTRY_MODULES)
- Database-backed entries can also be added via the `sethelp` command in-game

SUBTOPIC SYNTAX:
- Single # creates a top-level subtopic
- Double ## creates nested subtopics
- Subtopics are navigable with: help <topic> <subtopic>

================================================================================
SECTION 7: IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. HELP FILE ORGANIZATION:

   Suggested structure for help_entries.py:
   
   # Core Game Knowledge
   - help_v5_overview
   - help_mechanics_dice
   - help_glossary
   
   # Character Creation
   - help_chargen_tutorial
   - help_clans (with subtopics for each clan)
   - help_attributes
   - help_skills
   - help_disciplines_overview
   
   # Gameplay Systems
   - help_hunting
   - help_combat
   - help_humanity
   - help_boons
   - help_status
   - help_coteries
   - help_backgrounds
   - help_thinblood
   
   # Staff
   - help_staff_approval
   - help_staff_commands

2. HELP FILE FORMAT:

   - Keep entries under 2000 characters for readability
   - Use ANSI color codes for formatting (consistent with game theme)
   - Include examples with each command-related help entry
   - Use consistent formatting across all entries
   - Include "See also:" references to related help topics
   - Add "Related commands:" for command help entries

3. COMMAND HELP INTEGRATION:

   Current situation:
   - Commands have docstrings (good start)
   - But players access help via `help <topic>` not command docstrings
   - Need to create dedicated help entries for discoverability
   
   Recommendation:
   - Keep command docstrings (they help staff reading code)
   - Create comprehensive help_entries for each command
   - Ensure help topics match command names where possible

4. CONTENT DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:

   Phase 1 (Week 1):
   - Write critical priority topics
   - Get staff review for accuracy
   - Test with new players

   Phase 2 (Week 2):
   - Write high priority topics
   - Refine based on new player feedback
   - Create search-friendly aliases

   Phase 3 (Ongoing):
   - Add medium/lower priority topics
   - Maintain and update as features change
   - Gather player feedback on help clarity

5. FILE ORGANIZATION BEST PRACTICES:

   - Each major system should have its own help_entry dict
   - Use aliases liberally for discoverability
   - Add cross-references between related topics
   - Include examples where applicable
   - Keep language simple and clear (not overly technical)
   - Include roleplay context and flavor text

6. TESTING:

   - Have staff test all help entries before going live
