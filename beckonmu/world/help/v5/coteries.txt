# Coteries

## What is a Coterie?

A coterie is a group of vampires who band together for mutual benefit, protection,
and shared resources. In Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition, coteries represent
the vampire equivalent of a "pack" or "crew" - a close-knit group that shares
resources, secrets, and often works toward common goals.

Coteries can control shared resources such as:
- **Domain**: Territory controlled by the coterie
- **Haven**: Shared safe houses and lairs
- **Herd**: Reliable feeding sources
- **Contacts**: Mortal allies and connections

## Coterie Structure

Coteries have a simple hierarchy:

- **Leader**: The founder who manages the coterie and its resources. Only the
  leader can invite members, manage resources, promote/demote members, and
  disband the coterie.

- **Lieutenant**: Trusted second-in-command. May have additional responsibilities
  granted by the leader.

- **Member**: Regular coterie members who share in the group's resources and
  protection.

## Creating a Coterie

Use `+coterie/create <name>=<description>` to found a new coterie. You must not
already be in a coterie.

Example:
  `+coterie/create Night Watch=Protectors of the Elysium who maintain order`

**Disbanding** (Leader only)

## Managing Resources

**Viewing Resources**
  `+coterie/resources`

  View all coterie resources and their ratings.

**Setting Resources** (Leader only)
  `+coterie/resource <type>=<value>`

  Set a resource rating (0-5).

  Resource types: domain, haven, herd, contacts

  Examples:
    `+coterie/resource domain=3`
    `+coterie/resource haven=2`
    `+coterie/resource herd=1`
    `+coterie/resource contacts=4`

## Resource Descriptions

**Domain (0-5)**
  Territory under the coterie's control. Higher ratings indicate larger or more
  valuable territory. Domain provides safe hunting grounds and political influence.

**Haven (0-5)**
  The quality and security of the coterie's shared havens. Higher ratings mean
  better protected, more comfortable, or more numerous safe houses.

**Herd (0-5)**
  Reliable mortal feeding sources cultivated by the coterie. A higher Herd rating
  means easier and safer feeding for coterie members.

**Contacts (0-5)**
  Mortal allies, informants, and connections the coterie can call upon. Higher
  ratings provide access to more influential or numerous contacts.

## Integration with Social Systems

Coteries integrate with the broader social systems of Kindred society:

**Status**: Coterie leaders often have Status in Kindred society. A well-respected
coterie can enhance its members' standing.

**Boons**: Coteries can owe and be owed boons as a group, not just as individuals.
The leader manages collective prestation.

**Political Standing**: Your coterie membership is displayed when using the
`+social` command, showing your role and coterie affiliation.

## Viewing Coterie Information

**Your Coterie**
  `+coterie`

  resources, and your role.

**Social Standing**
  `+social`
  `+social <character>`

  membership all in one display.

## Tips for Coterie Play

1. **Choose complementary members**: A good coterie has vampires with different
   skills, clans, and capabilities.

2. **Pool your backgrounds**: The coterie system represents characters combining
   their Background dots to create shared resources.

3. **Communicate OOC**: Coordinate with your coterie members outside the game to
   ensure everyone benefits from membership.

4. **Use your resources**: Don't just track resources - incorporate them into
   your roleplay. Feed from your Herd, meet in your Haven, leverage your Contacts.

5. **Political power**: A united coterie has more influence than individual
   vampires. Use this to your advantage in Kindred politics.
