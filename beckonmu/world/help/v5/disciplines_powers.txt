Most discipline powers require a Rouse check. When you activate such a power:

- Bestial Failure (1): Hunger increases AND your Beast stirs

The power activates regardless of the Rouse check result, but failure means you're closer to losing control.

## Amalgam Powers

Some advanced powers require knowledge of multiple disciplines. For example:
- Possession (Auspex 5) requires Dominate 3
- Unerring Aim (Celerity 4) requires Auspex 2
- Living Hive (Animalism 3) requires Obfuscate 2

You must have BOTH disciplines at the required levels to use amalgam powers.
