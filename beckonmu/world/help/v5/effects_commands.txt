|WEFFECT TYPES:|n

Effects can modify various aspects of your character:

  |ybonus_dice|n - Extra dice to specific rolls
  |ydefense_bonus|n - Increased defense in combat
  |ydamage_reduction|n - Reduced incoming damage
  |yspeed_bonus|n - Enhanced movement/initiative
  |ysensory|n - Enhanced perception abilities
  |ystealth|n - Concealment effects

The specific parameters depend on the discipline power used.

|WHOW EFFECTS ARE CREATED:|n

Effects are automatically created when you activate discipline
powers using |y+power|n. Not all powers create lasting effects -
some are instant (like dealing damage) or passive (always on).

Powers that typically create effects:
  - Celerity (speed bonuses)
  - Fortitude (damage reduction)
  - Obfuscate (concealment)
  - Presence (social bonuses)
  - Protean (physical changes)

|WMANAGING YOUR EFFECTS:|n

1. Check active effects before important rolls
2. Note effect IDs for reference
3. Track turn-based effects during combat
4. Ask ST to clear effects when scenes end

|yTip:|n Effects from the same power don't stack. Activating a
power again will replace the existing effect.
