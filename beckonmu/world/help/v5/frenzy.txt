|[R+===================================================================+|n

Frenzy is when the Beast takes control, overriding your rational mind with
primal instinct. Vampires can enter frenzy when provoked, starving, or
confronted with their banes (fire, sunlight, etc.).

|WFRENZY TYPES:|n

|WHunger Frenzy|n
  Triggered by: Blood scent, Hunger 5, failed Rouse checks, seeing mortals
  bleed
  Effect: Uncontrolled feeding - you attack the nearest source of blood
  Difficulty: 2-4 (higher at Hunger 5)

|WFury Frenzy|n
  Triggered by: Provocation, humiliation, physical attacks, insults
  Effect: Violent rage - you attack the source of your anger
  Difficulty: 3+ (Brujah have +2 difficulty due to clan bane)

|WTerror Frenzy (Rötschreck)|n
  Triggered by: Fire, sunlight, True Faith
  Effect: Blind panic - you flee in terror
  Difficulty: 3-5 depending on the threat

|WRESTISTING FRENZY:|n

To resist frenzy, you roll |WWillpower + Composure|n vs a Difficulty set by
the trigger. This roll includes |WHunger dice|n like any other roll.

Formula: |WWillpower + Composure|n vs Difficulty

The Difficulty is based on:
• Base difficulty of the trigger type (2-5)
• +1 per 2 points of Hunger (Hunger 4-5 makes frenzy more likely)
• +2 for Brujah resisting fury frenzy (clan bane)
• ST may adjust based on circumstances

|yExample:|n A Brujah with Willpower 5, Composure 3, and Hunger 4 is
insulted (fury frenzy). Base difficulty is 3, +2 for Brujah bane, +2 for
Hunger 4 = Difficulty 7. They roll 8 dice (5+3) with 4 Hunger dice.

|WFRENZY CONSEQUENCES:|n

When you enter frenzy:

• You |Wlose control|n of your character - the ST or game system determines
  your actions
• You gain the |WBeast's Traits|n - increased physical prowess but no
  cunning
• You cannot use |WDisciplines|n that require concentration (Dominate,
  Auspex, etc.)
• You |Wmay|n use physical Disciplines automatically (Celerity, Potence)
• You gain |W1 Stain|n for actions taken during frenzy (at ST discretion)
• You may violate your |WConvictions|n or harm |WTouchstones|n, gaining more
  Stains

|WRIDING THE WAVE:|n

Instead of resisting frenzy, you can choose to |W"ride the wave"|n - you
accept the frenzy and give in to the Beast, but maintain some narrative
control over your actions.

Benefits:
• You don't need to roll to resist
• You can guide your actions somewhat (with ST approval)
• You may avoid some Stains by directing the frenzy appropriately

Drawbacks:
• You're still in frenzy - the Beast is in charge
• You must pursue the frenzy's goal (feed, fight, flee)
• You may still gain Stains for your actions

|WENDING FRENZY:|n

Frenzy typically lasts until:
• The trigger is resolved (fed enough, enemy defeated, escaped danger)
• The ST determines the scene has ended
• Another vampire uses |WDominate|n to snap you out of it
• You fulfill the Beast's desire

After frenzy ends, you regain control and must deal with the consequences
of your actions.
