|[R+===================================================================+|n

Humanity represents your connection to mortal life and your resistance to
the Beast. It's measured on a scale of 0-10, with vampires typically
starting at Humanity 7.

|WHUMANITY SCALE (0-10):|n

|WHumanity 10|n - |WSaint|n
  - Truly exceptional moral compass
  - Can have up to 5 Touchstones
  - Very rare among vampires

|WHumanity 7-9|n - |wHuman|n
  - Strong connection to mortal values
  - 3-4 Touchstones available
  - Most newly Embraced vampires

|WHumanity 4-6|n - |yJaded|n
  - Moral flexibility, some detachment
  - 2-3 Touchstones available
  - Many established vampires

|WHumanity 1-3|n - |[RMonstrous|n
  - Barely clinging to humanity
  - 0-1 Touchstones available
  - The Beast is very close

|WHumanity 0|n - |[RWassail|n
  - Total loss of humanity
  - The Beast has won
  - Character becomes an NPC

|WSTAINS:|n

Stains represent moral transgressions that weigh on your conscience. You
gain Stains when you:

• Violate |WChronicle Tenets|n (1-3 Stains depending on severity)
• Violate your personal |WConvictions|n (1-2 Stains)
• Suffer a |WMessy Critical|n during feeding or violence (1 Stain)
• Harm or lose a |WTouchstone|n (1-3 Stains)

When you accumulate Stains, you must eventually perform a |W+remorse|n roll.

|WREMORSE ROLLS:|n

At the end of a game session (or when directed by an ST), you roll for
Remorse to see if you can cope with your actions:

1. Roll a dice pool equal to your current |WHumanity|n rating
2. If you get |Wmore successes than your current Stains|n, you keep your
   Humanity and clear all Stains
3. If you get |Wequal or fewer successes|n, you |Wlose 1 Humanity|n and
   clear all Stains

|yExample:|n You have Humanity 6 and 4 Stains. You roll 6 dice and get 5
successes. Since 5 > 4, you maintain Humanity and clear all Stains.

|WCONVICTIONS:|n

Convictions are your personal moral code - beliefs that define who you are.
You can have up to |W3 Convictions|n.

Examples:
• "Never harm children"
• "Protect the innocent"
• "Always repay my debts"
• "Never betray my word"

When you violate a Conviction, you gain |W1-2 Stains|n depending on severity.

Commands:
  |W+humanity/conviction <text>|n - Add a new Conviction
  |W+humanity/conviction/remove <number>|n - Remove a Conviction

|WTOUCHSTONES:|n

Touchstones are mortals who anchor your Humanity - people who remind you
what it means to be human. You can have a maximum of |WHumanity ÷ 2|n
Touchstones (rounded down).

Examples:
• Your mortal sister who doesn't know you're a vampire
• A priest who gives you spiritual guidance
• A former lover you still watch over

If a Touchstone dies or discovers your nature, you may lose them and must
roll to avoid Humanity loss (or gain Stains at ST discretion).

Commands:
  |W+humanity/touchstone <name>=<description>|n - Add a Touchstone
  |W+humanity/touchstone/remove <number>|n - Remove a Touchstone

|WCOMMANDS:|n

|W+humanity|n
  View your Humanity rating, Stains, Convictions, and Touchstones

|W+humanity/conviction <text>|n
  Add a new Conviction (max 3)

|W+humanity/touchstone <name>=<description>|n
  Add a new Touchstone (max = Humanity ÷ 2)

|W+stain [<count>]|n
  Add Stains to yourself (typically used by ST or after Messy Criticals)

|W+remorse|n
  Perform a Remorse roll to resist Humanity loss
