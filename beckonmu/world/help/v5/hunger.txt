|W|                        HUNGER SYSTEM                              |
|[R+===================================================================+|n

Hunger replaces the traditional Blood Pool in V5. It represents the vampire's
desperation for blood and the closeness of the Beast.

|WHUNGER SCALE (0-5):|n

|WHunger 0|n - |WSated|n
  • No Hunger dice
  • Rare and temporary - the vampire is fully fed

|WHunger 1-2|n - |wPeckish / Hungry|n
  • 1-2 Hunger dice replace normal dice in rolls
  • Manageable but noticeable urge to feed

|WHunger 3-4|n - |yRavenous / Famished|n
  • 3-4 Hunger dice in rolls
  • Strong compulsion to feed
  • May trigger frenzy in stressful situations

|WHunger 5|n - |[RStarving|n
  • All dice are Hunger dice
  • |[RCritical state|n - frenzy tests at difficulty +2
  • Cannot reduce Hunger below 1 without special circumstances

|WHUNGER DICE MECHANICS:|n

When you roll dice, normal dice are replaced by |[RHunger dice|n based on
your current Hunger level.

|yExample:|n You have Dexterity 3 + Stealth 2 = 5 dice pool, Hunger 2
  • You roll |W3 normal dice|n + |[R2 Hunger dice|n

|ySuccesses:|n Both normal and Hunger dice count successes (6+)
|yCriticals (10s):|n Hunger dice rolling 10 create |[RMessy Criticals|n
|yBestial Failure:|n Total failure with Hunger dice present triggers the Beast

|WMESSY CRITICAL:|n

When a critical success (pair of 10s) includes at least one Hunger die:
  • |gYou succeed spectacularly|n
  • |[RBUT|n the Beast feeds on your success
  • Violent, dramatic, or obvious supernatural display
  • May threaten the Masquerade or create complications

|WBESTIAL FAILURE:|n

When you fail a roll (0 successes) and rolled Hunger dice:
  • You fail the task
  • Your clan |[RCompulsion|n activates
  • The Beast asserts control temporarily
  • Roleplayed as character acting on their vice

|WINCREASING HUNGER:|n

Hunger increases when you:
  • Fail a |yRouse check|n (rolling discipline powers)
  • Wake for the night (sometimes)
  • Use certain high-level powers
  • Sustain significant damage

|yCommand:|n Your current Hunger is shown on your |y+sheet|n

|WDECREASING HUNGER (FEEDING):|n

Hunger decreases by feeding on:
  • |wMortals|n - Most effective, but risks Masquerade breach
  • |wAnimals|n - Only works at low Blood Potency
  • |wBlood bags|n - Only works at low Blood Potency
  • |wOther vampires|n - Creates blood bonds, politically dangerous

Feeding is |yroleplayed|n - use |y+feed|n command to mechanically reduce Hunger
after describing your feeding scene.
