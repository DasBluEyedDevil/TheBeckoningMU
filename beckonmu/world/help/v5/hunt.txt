|W|                        HUNTING SYSTEM                             |
|[R+===================================================================+|n

Vampires must hunt mortals to reduce their Hunger. The Beckoning MU provides
two ways to hunt: quick automated hunts and staff-run hunt scenes.

|WQUICK HUNT (+hunt):|n

Use |y+hunt|n for a quick, automated hunting scene. This performs a dice roll
based on your Predator Type and reduces your Hunger on success.

|ySyntax:|n
  |y+hunt|n                  - Hunt in a random location
  |y+hunt <location>|n       - Hunt in a specific location
  |y+huntinfo|n              - View available hunting locations

|yExample:|n
  +hunt nightclub          Hunt at a nightclub (Siren/Osiris bonus)
  +hunt hospital           Hunt at a hospital (Bagger/Cleaver bonus)

|WPREDATOR TYPE BONUSES:|n

Your Predator Type determines your hunting dice pool and bonus dice:

|yAlleycat|n (Strength + Brawl +1) - Aggressive street feeding
|yBagger|n (Intelligence + Streetwise) - Stealing blood bags
|yBlood Leech|n (Strength + Brawl) - Feeding on other vampires

|[RBestial Failure:|n Hunt fails and triggers clan Compulsion

|WSTAFF-RUN HUNT SCENES:|n

For more detailed roleplayed hunting, request a staff-run hunt scene through
the Jobs system. Staff will run a full hunting scene with NPCs, complications,
and roleplayed feeding.

|ySyntax:|n
  |yjob/create hunt=|yRequest for staff-run hunt scene in [location]|n

Staff-run hunts provide:
  - Full roleplay with mortal NPCs
  - Resonance selection (Choleric, Melancholic, Phlegmatic, Sanguine)
  - Potential for Dyscrasia (powerful temporary blood)
  - Complications and Masquerade threats
  - Better Hunger reduction (up to 3 Hunger)
