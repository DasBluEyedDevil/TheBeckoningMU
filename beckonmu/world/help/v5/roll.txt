V5 uses |yd10 dice pools|n to resolve actions. This guide explains how
rolls work and when to use them.

|WBASIC ROLL STRUCTURE:|n

Roll |yAttribute + Skill|n dice vs. |yDifficulty|n

|yExample:|n Sneak past a guard
  • Pool: |wDexterity 3 + Stealth 2 = 5 dice|n
  • Difficulty: |w2 successes|n (set by ST or situation)
  • Roll 5d10, count successes

|ySuccess:|n 6, 7, 8, 9 on any die = |w1 success|n
|yCritical:|n |w10|n = 1 success |gAND|n pairs of 10s grant |g+2 successes|n
|yFailure:|n 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = no success

|yExample:|n You roll: [3, 6, 7, 10, 10]
  • Successes: 6, 7, 10, 10 = 4 successes
  • Critical: Two 10s = |g+2 bonus|n = |g6 total successes|n
