|c1. POSING STANDARDS|n

|yMinimum Standards|n
- Posts should be at least 2-3 sentences
- Include actions, thoughts, or dialogue
- Give other players something to respond to
- Proofread for clarity (typos happen, but try!)

|yGood Posing Practices|n
```
|gGood Example:|n
  Sophia leans against the bar, her eyes tracking the newcomer with
  predatory interest. "You're new here," she purrs, voice barely above
  a whisper. Her fingers drum against her wine glass - a mortal
  affectation she can't quite shake, even after fifty years.

|rPoor Example:|n
  She looks at him. "Hi."
```

|yPose Content|n
- Describe your character's actions and demeanor
- Include sensory details (what others see/hear)
- Show, don't tell when possible
- Avoid mind-reading or assumptions about others

|w═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════|n

|c2. POWER-POSING & GOD-MODING|n

|yForbidden Actions|n
- |rDon't|n decide the outcome of your actions on others
- |rDon't|n control another player's character
- |rDon't|n auto-hit in combat without dice rolls
- |rDon't|n ignore established continuity

|yExamples|n

|rPower-Posing (Bad):|n
  Marcus grabs the Tremere by the throat and slams him against the
  wall, cutting off his air supply.

|gProper Posing (Good):|n
  Marcus lunges forward, attempting to grab the Tremere by the throat
  and pin him against the wall.
  OOC: |w+roll dexterity + brawl|n

|w═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════|n

|wIC Actions That Need Discussion:|n
- Blood Bonds (3 drinks over multiple scenes)
- Major betrayals affecting multiple characters
- Plots that significantly affect others' stories

|yHow to Request Consent|n
```
OOC: Hey, I was thinking Marcus might try to blood bond your
      character over the next few scenes. Is that something
      you'd be interested in exploring?

OOC: My character might attack yours if provoked. Are you okay
      with that? We can use the combat system or narrate it.
```

|yFade to Black|n

- No explanation needed, no questions asked
