|WHOW IT WORKS:|n

1. System calculates your total dice pool from traits
2. Applies modifiers:
   - |[R-2 dice|n if you're Impaired (at half Health or less)
   - |g+dice|n from active discipline powers (Celerity, Potence)
3. Rolls against target's Defense (Dexterity + Athletics)
4. Displays margin of success for damage calculation

|WATTACK RESOLUTION:|n

|ySuccess:|n You hit! Margin of success added to weapon damage
|yFailure:|n You miss or target dodges
|yCritical:|n Multiple 10s rolled - exceptional success

After a successful attack, use |y+damage|n to apply the result.

|WDEFENSE:|n

Defense = |yDexterity + Athletics|n

Modifiers to defense:
  - Active Celerity powers add defense bonus
  - Cover provides situational bonuses (ST adjudication)
  - Surprised targets may have reduced defense

|WDISCIPLINE BONUSES:|n

  |yPotence:|n Adds damage to physical attacks
  |yCelerity:|n May grant extra actions or defense bonuses
  |yFortitude:|n Provides damage reduction when defending

|WCOMBAT TIPS:|n

  - Activate Potence |ybefore|n attacking for bonus damage
  - Use Celerity for defense boost against counter-attacks
  - Target Impaired opponents for easier hits
  - Consider environment and tactics, not just dice

|WNOTES:|n

  - Impairment penalty applies if you're at ≤50% Health
  - Some weapons modify damage or attack pools
  - Storytellers may apply situational modifiers
  - Combat should enhance narrative, not replace it
