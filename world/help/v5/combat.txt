# V5 Combat System

## Overview

The V5 Combat System provides mechanics for resolving conflicts between characters, from simple brawls to deadly confrontations. Combat in Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition emphasizes narrative flow while maintaining mechanical rigor.

## Core Concepts

### Health Tracker

Characters have Health boxes equal to **Stamina + 3**. Each box can contain:
- **O** = Healthy (no damage)
- **/** = Superficial Damage (heals quickly)
- **X** = Aggravated Damage (severe, hard to heal)

Example: `[O O / / X X]` shows 2 healthy, 2 superficial, 2 aggravated boxes.

### Damage Types

**Superficial Damage**
- Fills health boxes from left to right
- Relatively easy to heal for vampires (Blood Surge)
- When all boxes are filled with superficial damage, additional superficial damage converts to aggravated
- Represents: Bruises, minor cuts, fatigue

**Aggravated Damage**
- Fills health boxes from right to left
- Very difficult to heal, requires extended rest or powerful magic
- Takes precedence over superficial damage
- Represents: Fire, sunlight, supernatural attacks, grievous wounds

**Lethal Damage**
- For mortals, fills from left like superficial but harder to heal
- For vampires, converts to superficial damage (due to undead resilience)
- Represents: Gunshots, stab wounds, serious injuries

### Impairment

When a character is reduced to **half their maximum Health or less**, they suffer a **-2 dice penalty** to all actions. This represents the difficulty of functioning while grievously injured.

Example: Character with 5 Health at 2 Health or less is Impaired (-2 dice).

## Combat Resolution

### 1. Attack Roll

**Command:** `+attack <target>=<dice pool>`

The attacker rolls their attack pool against the defender's Defense. Common attack pools:
- **Brawl:** Strength + Brawl
- **Melee:** Strength + Melee (or Dexterity + Melee for finesse weapons)
- **Firearms:** Composure + Firearms (or Dexterity + Firearms for quick shots)

**Example:**
```
+attack Bob=Strength + Brawl
+attack Alice=Dexterity + Firearms
```

The system automatically:
- Calculates your total dice pool from specified traits
- Applies impairment penalty if you're injured
- Rolls against target's Defense
- Displays margin of success for damage

### 2. Defense

**Defense = Dexterity + Athletics**

Defense is calculated automatically when you're attacked. Modifiers include:
- **Celerity:** Active Celerity powers add defense bonus
- **Cover:** Storyteller may add situational modifiers
- **Surprised:** Defense may be reduced or negated

### 3. Damage Application

**Command:** `+damage <target>=<amount>/<type>`

After a successful attack, apply damage based on:
- Weapon damage rating
- Margin of success on attack roll
- Special abilities (Potence adds damage)

**Examples:**
```
+damage Bob=3/superficial
+damage Alice=2/aggravated
+damage Charlie=5/lethal
```

**Damage Calculation:**
- Base weapon damage + margin of success
- Plus any discipline bonuses (Potence)
- Minus any damage reduction (Fortitude)

### 4. Healing

**Command:** `+heal <target>=<amount>/<type>`

Healing damage depends on the type:

**Superficial Damage:**
- Vampires: Blood Surge (Rouse check) heals based on Blood Potency
- Mortals: First Aid, medical care, or natural healing over time
- Generally heals quickly (hours to days)

**Aggravated Damage:**
- Vampires: Extended rest in torpor, or powerful blood rituals
- Mortals: Extended medical care
- Generally heals slowly (weeks to months)

**Examples:**
```
+heal self=2/superficial
+heal Bob=1/aggravated
```

## Discipline Effects in Combat

### Celerity
- **Defense Bonus:** Active Celerity powers provide bonus to Defense
- **Initiative:** Act faster in combat rounds
- **Extra Actions:** Some powers grant additional actions

### Fortitude
- **Damage Reduction:** Reduce incoming damage (soak)
- **Resilience:** Resist effects that would incapacitate
- **Endurance:** Ignore impairment penalties

### Potence
- **Damage Bonus:** Add extra damage to physical attacks
- **Crushing Blows:** Overwhelm defenses and armor
- **Feats of Strength:** Grapple and overpower opponents

## Combat Commands

### +attack <target>=<pool>
Perform attack roll against target.

**Usage:**
```
+attack Bob=Strength + Brawl
+attack Alice=Dexterity + Melee
+attack Charlie
```

If no pool specified, defaults to "Strength + Brawl".

### +damage <target>=<amount>/<type>
Apply damage to target.

**Usage:**
```
+damage Bob=3/superficial
+damage Alice=2/aggravated
+damage Charlie=4/lethal
```

If no type specified, defaults to superficial.

### +heal <target>=<amount>/<type>
Heal damage on target.

**Usage:**
```
+heal self=2/superficial
+heal Bob=1/aggravated
+heal Alice=3
```

Requires appropriate permissions or use of healing powers.

### +health [target]
Display current health status.

**Usage:**
```
+health
+health Bob
```

Shows health boxes, damage breakdown, and impairment status.

## Combat Tactics

### For Attackers
1. **Choose Your Pool Wisely:** Use your best traits for attack pools
2. **Leverage Disciplines:** Activate Potence before attacking, use Celerity for defense
3. **Target Weaknesses:** Some opponents have better physical or mental defenses
4. **Manage Hunger:** Remember that using disciplines requires Rouse checks

### For Defenders
1. **Boost Defense:** Activate Celerity powers before combat
2. **Use Cover:** Ask ST for situational defense bonuses
3. **Fortitude Soak:** Active Fortitude reduces incoming damage
4. **Escape When Needed:** Discretion is the better part of valor

### For Storytellers
1. **Narrative First:** Use combat to enhance story, not replace it
2. **Consequence Matters:** Combat should have lasting effects
3. **Flexible Difficulty:** Adjust target numbers for dramatic tension
4. **Environmental Factors:** Use terrain, time pressure, and complications

## Combat Flow Example

```
> +attack Bob=Strength + Brawl

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
│ ATTACK ROLL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Attacker: Alice
Target: Bob
Attack Pool: Strength 3 + Brawl 2 = 5
Defense: 4

Roll: [6] [8] [3] [9] [1] → 3 successes

Attack succeeds! 3 successes vs 4 defense.
Margin of success: 0

Damage: Base weapon damage + 0 (margin)

Use +damage Bob=<amount>/<type> to apply damage.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

> +damage Bob=2/superficial

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
│ DAMAGE APPLIED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Target: Bob
You take 2 Superficial damage.

Health: [O / / X] (Impaired: -2 dice)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Tips for Narrative Combat

1. **Describe Actions:** Don't just roll dice, describe what your character does
2. **Use Environment:** Incorporate surroundings into combat
3. **Character Goals:** What does each character want from this confrontation?
4. **Consequences:** Win or lose, what changes after this combat?
5. **Pacing:** Keep combat moving, don't get bogged down in minutiae

## When Combat Goes Wrong

### Torpor (Vampires)
When all Health boxes are filled with damage:
- If any boxes contain Aggravated: Final Death (character destroyed)
- If all Superficial: Enter Torpor (death-like sleep)
- Torpor duration depends on Humanity and Blood Potency

### Death (Mortals)
Mortals die when all Health boxes are filled with Lethal or Aggravated damage.

### Surrender and Mercy
Combat doesn't always end in death. Consider:
- Yielding before taking fatal damage
- Taking prisoners for interrogation
- Creating Blood Bonds through forced feeding
- Leaving survivors as warnings
