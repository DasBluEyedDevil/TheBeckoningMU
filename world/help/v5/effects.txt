# Discipline Effects

## What are Discipline Effects?

Many discipline powers have ongoing effects that last beyond the moment of
activation. The effects system tracks these active powers, their durations,
and their parameters.

When you activate a discipline power that has a duration, it creates an
active effect that persists until it expires or is removed.

## Viewing Active Effects

To see all your currently active discipline effects:

    +effects

This displays:
- Power name and discipline
- Effect ID (for staff management)
- Duration type and time remaining
- Effect parameters and modifiers
- When the effect was applied

## Duration Types

Effects can have different duration types:

**Scene Duration**
- Lasts until the current scene ends
- Storyteller determines when scene ends
- Most common for social and stealth powers
- Examples: Cloak of Shadows, Awe, Heightened Senses

**Turn Duration**
- Lasts a specific number of combat turns
- Automatically decrements each turn (when ticked)
- Used for combat-focused powers
- Examples: Some Celerity and Fortitude powers

**Permanent Duration**
- Effect lasts until explicitly removed
- Common for memory alteration and lasting changes
- Examples: Forgetful Mind, Terminal Decree

**Instant**
- No duration tracking needed
- Power takes immediate effect then ends
- Examples: Blood Surge, many Animalism powers

## Effect Interactions

Active effects can modify your capabilities:

- **Obfuscate effects** make you invisible or disguised
- **Dominate effects** track mental commands on targets
- **Auspex effects** enhance your perception
- **Celerity effects** boost your speed and defense
- **Fortitude effects** increase your resilience
- **Presence effects** influence emotions of others
- **Protean effects** track transformations and animal features

The Storyteller determines exactly how these effects apply to dice pools
and in-game situations.

## Activating Powers with Effects

When you activate a discipline power with a duration:

    +power obfuscate/cloak of shadows

If successful, you'll see:
- The power activation message
- Rouse check result (if applicable)
- Effect duration information
- Effect ID (for reference)

Use `+effects` to view the effect at any time.

## Blood Sorcery Rituals

Blood Sorcery rituals are a special type of effect. Rituals typically:
- Require specific components or ingredients
- Take time to perform (casting time varies)
- Create lasting or permanent effects
- Are more powerful than standard powers

Ritual effects are tracked the same way as other discipline effects.

## Staff Commands

Staff can manage effects with additional switches:

**Clear Specific Effect**
    +effects/clear <effect_id>

Removes a specific effect by its ID.

**Clear All Effects**
    +effects/clear all

Removes all active effects from the character.

**Tick Turn-Based Effects**
    +effects/tick

Decrements all turn-based effect durations by one turn and removes
expired effects.

## Important Notes

- Scene-based effects don't automatically expire - the ST controls scenes
- You can have multiple effects active simultaneously
- Some effects may stack, others may not (ST discretion)
- Effects persist across server reloads
- Logging out does not clear effects
- Only staff can remove effects manually

## Related Commands

- `+disciplines` - View your known disciplines and powers
- `+power <discipline>/<power>` - Activate a discipline power
- `+powerinfo <discipline>/<power>` - View power details
- `+sheet` - View your character sheet

## Tips for Players

1. Always check `+effects` before activating another power of the same type
2. Note your effect IDs for reference in roleplay
3. Coordinate with ST about when scene-based effects end
4. Some effects work better in combination - experiment!
5. Remember that visible effects (like Protean transformations) will be
   noticed by others
